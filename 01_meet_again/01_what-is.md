# What is Javascript?

Meet with JavaScript again to have a better understanding of language.

::: warning
Probably you underestimated JavaScript. Here is an re-introduction to JavaScript.
:::

## The programming language of the internet <FontIcon icon="wifi" size="23" />

JavaScript is the most-deployed programming language in the history of computers. Because it runs on every web browser. It’s easy to learn and start coding.

The programs in this language are called scripts. Scripts do not need any preparation or compilation. They can run directly on some special softwares which are called javascript engines.

## Javascript Engine <FontIcon icon="cogs" size="23" />

Every browser includes a javascript engine.

1. First The engine reads the script.
1. Then it converts the script to the machine language.
1. Finally, the machine code runs, very fast.

## What makes JavaScript unique? <FontIcon icon="fingerprint" size="23" />

* It has full integration with HTML/CSS
* Simple, you can learn a few things and then start to build right after.
* Supported by all browsers and enabled by default.

:::tip
JavaScript is built on some good ideas and some bad-looking ideas which as time goes by, appears to be a perfect solution for internet sites.
:::

### High-level language

Human-readable and understandable

### Dynamic Typing

You are free to change the type of data in your code,reassign any type to a variable

### Loosely typed

JavaScript does not force the type of an object, allowing more flexibility but denying us type safety and type checking

### It's multi-paradigm

Can be used in object-oriented and functional programming styles)

### Interpreted

JavaScript does not need a compilation stage before a program can run

### Safety

Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers that do not require it.
JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of a user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil web page from accessing private information or harming the user’s data. JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write unplanned files on the hard disk. It can not copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.

Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting a file with an `<input>` HTML tag.
Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other because they shouldn't.

JavaScript can add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, and modify styles. React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, and key presses.
Send requests over the network to remote servers, and download and upload files. Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, and show messages.
It can store some data on the client-side on browsers' local storage.

## Last 10 years

Javascript developers started to use it more than just browser applications. Now it's used for server-side and mobile applications too.

Backend developers; prefer it because of its streaming speed.

Mobile developers prefer javascript to take advantage of a simple link to cloud data.

## What can you build with it?

**Web Applications**: Youtube , Netflix, Spotify

**Desktop Applications**: WhatsApp Desktop, Skype, Discord, Visual Studio Code, Slack

**Servers**: Every server can be build using Express.js

**Multi-Platform Mobile apps**: All kind of mobile apps can be build using React, NativeScript
