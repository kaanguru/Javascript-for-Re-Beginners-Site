# "use strict"

Adding `"use strict"` before your code makes your code modern javascript. JavaScript engines are clever enough to know you are using newly added features and turn on use `"strict mode"` automatically.

You do not need to add before all your scripts but if you want to **Burn the bridges between today and ECMAScript 5 (ES5)**, it's a good idea.

Like all professional developers, we will develop using JavaScript compilers like babel or  [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#alwaysStrict) so don't worry about  _"use strict"_ and browser-compatible JavaScript. Compilers deal with it automatically.

::: tip
Since using  _"use strict"_ or _'use strict'_ rarely makes difference. I won't be using it in our course.
