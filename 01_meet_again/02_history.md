# History

## Early Days

JavaScript was created in 1995 in 10 days, by one worker in Netscape for their web browser, Netscape Navigator.
Java language was very popular at that time,so they first named it Mocha then  they called it LiveScript. And final javascript name was given end of 95.
Syntax of JavaScript is similar to Java language.
JavaScript was created at Netscape in the early days of the web, and technically, “Java‐Script” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems which is now Oracle. This javascript name used to describe Netscape’s implementation of the language.

## ECMAScript 1997

 Netscape  which is now Mozilla. they submitted the language for standardization to ECMA—the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association—and because of trademark issues, the standardized version of the language is named “ECMAScript.” In practice, everyone just calls the language JavaScript.

### ES5 2009

As a matter of fact, until version ECMAScript 5  came which is 2009, javascript had a bad reputation. We were trying to make everything on server side. Php was in our control but javascript was non-trusted and it was used as a last resort language. Do you need a text area check for emails? Don't trust javascript test it on server side. There were always some compatibility issues until a few standard library features and strict mode.

### ES6 2015

Since ES6, the ECMAScript specification has moved to a yearly release order, and versions of the language—ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019, and ES2020—are now identified by year of release. Today ES2020 standard has been supported by let's say 95% of all web browsers.

Developers of language tried to be backward compatible from day one. Javascript did not change any functionalities not to break code of users. And there were just couple of hundred websites using javascript before 97.
So in Javascript New versions are always completely backward compatible and Old features aren’t removed or fixed. Instead, better versions of them are introduced.But what happens if a important part of the language changes? well it's done inside a new syntactic construct.

## Versioning Javascript

::: tip
The JavaScript standard is referred to officially as “ECMAScript”
(abbreviated “ES”), and up until just recently has been versioned
entirely by ordinal number (i.e., “5” for “5th edition”)
:::

A new specification version is released every year. Ecmascript proposals are made by Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, Twitter.

Usually, before an official stamp of approval, a feature is de facto standardized by the probity of this early engine/tooling prototyping.

Starting with ES2016, it’s better to think in individual features: once a feature is ready for standardization, you can safely use it . Just check if this feature supported by the JavaScript engines you are targeting. You don’t have to wait until the next ECMAScript release.

:::warning
I will try to use all new features of ES.Next during Re-Beginners course
:::

:::tip
ES.Next is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at the time of writing. ES.Next features are more correctly called proposals, because, by definition, the specification has not been finalized yet.
