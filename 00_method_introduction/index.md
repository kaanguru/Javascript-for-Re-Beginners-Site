# Re-Beginners Method

Deep dive into the fundamentals of JavaScript

Human knowledge is expressed in language so while developing Re-Beginners Method; **I tried to understand software languages from a written and spoken language perspective**.

## 20 Years of Coding Professionally

I am 47 years old  software developer from Turkiye :tr:  I build web applications for 20 years :floppy_disk:
But last 5 years, I have noticed there were strange technological developments in javascript :unamused: I started to see some codes around which did not make any sense to me :older_man: It was clear I was missing some details.

So I decided to start over from beginning :man_technologist: I've **re-learned** everything about javascript. I prepared this course to share my experience in this re-learning process. :world_map: <FontIcon icon="route" size="23" color="Crimson"/>

## What you should already know

This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

- A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web ([WWW](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/World_Wide_Web)).
- Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language ([HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML)).
- Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the mdn main page about [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## For Whom Was This Course Prepared?

### 70 % of developers are second-language speakers of English

If you think you know JavaScript, this course for you.

Check if this course for you before you start climbing  :mount_fuji:

Did you try to self-teach programming from _free youtube videos_, but you couldn't seem to stick with it? Do you think that something is missing? Then, how about re-learning it like Learning a spoken language? Whatever you think you already know can be fast-forwarded with this Linguistic approach.

**JavaScript for re-beginners** is for young software students, who wants to have a strong background and interested in a complete javascript guide.

I want to share my 20 years of expertise to build a strong fundamental background your your software development career.  

## Learning Language by Linguistic Approach

I believe understanding how languages works is important. That's why I spend so much time on organizing this course.
It's intended for programmers who have been working with JavaScript at a beginner level and are now ready for a more sophisticated relationship with the language. JavaScript is a surprisingly powerful but most misunderstood language.
May be you had some coding lessons previously but feeling like youâ€™ve missed some basics.
This Linguistic approach is probably for you.
I will explain low-level fundamentals first, and then build on those to more
advanced and higher-level concepts

I will dive deeper while explaining hard to understand concepts but spend less time on basics.

Once you learn syntax of JavaScript which is similar to Java language, you will be able to learn  Typescript which is a strict data typing extension of javascript.
Next you can even learn some modern languages like Dart and Kotlin which has similar syntax too.

**It may take time to get used to my accent but you will learn to code for real!**
